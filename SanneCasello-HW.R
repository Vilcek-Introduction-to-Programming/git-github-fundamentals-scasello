# Let me know what you learned and what you are still confused about 
# re: Git/GitHub.

# I learned how to access repositories on github, download R and R studio
# and the fundamentals to use this as an analysis method for my research.

# Having previously coded in Matlab, I still am a little confused about and
# often make mistakes regarding Matlab versus R syntax etc. 

# In this file, also describe one of the ways that Wilson et. al. suggest is 
# a good practice for computational reproducibility and how a tool like R 
# and/or GitHub can be used.

# Wilson et.al.discusses best software practices in Box #1 2. Software. 
# Specifically, he says to test libraries before relying on them (something
# I will be careful about as I am not a proficient coder) and to not comment 
# and uncomment sections of code to control a program's behavior. 

# Save the file, add it to the repository, commit the changes, 
# and push the homework to the GitHub repository for the homework. 
# Note: At the end of this assignment, you should have one pull
# request and two files in your repository when finished 
# (the edited README.md file and the file that you added).
